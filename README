A Nagios (or Icinga or other Nagios-compatible software) plugin to
test the name servers of a DNS zone by querying every name server to
ask it the SOA of the zone.

Can detect non-responding servers and non-authoritative servers (lame
delegation).

Usage:
/the/directory/of/nagios/plugins/check_dns_soa -H zonename

Use -h to see all the other options.

The command-line options are not exactly following the Nagios standard
<http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html> This is
because Go's standard command-line options parsing module, "flag", does
not have exactly the semantics needed.

[If not already installed, install GoDNS]
# go get github.com/miekg/dns
% go build check_dns_soa.go
% cp check_dns_soa /the/directory/of/nagios/plugins
